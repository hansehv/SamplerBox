##  Adapt to your setup !
##  Don't delete value definitions, program expects them all (no internal defaults)
##    - exception to this rule: GPIO definitions of unused devices
##  Values are used as is with hardly any error checking, so: do it right !

AUDIO_DEVICE_ID = 2             ; Examples: 0 for PI-builtin or HiFiBerry, 2 for USB soundcard
USE_SERIALPORT_MIDI = False     ; Set to True to enable MIDI IN via SerialPort (e.g. RaspberryPi's GPIO UART pins)
USE_HD44780_16x2_LCD = True     ; Set to True to use a HD44780 based 16x2 LCD
USE_I2C_7SEGMENTDISPLAY = False ; Set to True to use a 7-segment display via I2C
USE_ALSA_MIXER = True           ; Set to True to use to use the alsa mixer (via pyalsaaudio)
MIXER_CONTROL = PCM,Speaker,Headphone,Digital ; Mixercontrols I experienced, add your soundcard's specific....
USE_48kHz = False               ; Output 48kHz iso 44100Hz. Try to avoid this...
USE_BUTTONS = True              ; Set to True to use momentary buttons connected to RaspberryPi's GPIO pins

BOXSAMPLE_MODE = Keyb	        ; we need a default: original samplerbox
#		Keyb	- reacts on "keyboard" interaction
#		Once	- ignores loop markers ("just play the sample with option to stop")
#		Onc2	- ignores loop markers with note-off by same note ("just play the sample with option to stop")
#		Loop	- recognize loop markers, note-off by 127-note ("just play the loop with option to stop")
#		Loo2	- recognize loop markers, note-off by same note ("just play the loop with option to stop")
#		Mono	- monophonic (with chords), loop like Loo2, but note/chord stops when next note is played.
BOXVELOCITY_MODE = Sample       ; we need a default: original samplerbox
#		Sample	- velocity equals sampled value, requires multiple samples to get differentation
#		Accurate- velocity as played, allows for multiple (normalized!) samples for timbre

######  Mapping of GPIO_pins: adapt to your hardware wiring/setup  #####
# GPIO modules in this build use mode=BCM. Modes cannot be mixed.
# Make sure used devices do not overlap in their pin usage (except power/gnd ofcourse),
# but for unused devices it is safe to keep or delete the definitions here as you like.
# In example below has overlaps; I use a box with buttons&LCD and one with HiFiBerry&Leds.
# Some devices require no mapping here, but do use pins:
#     -- EEPROM      : 0,1
#     -- Serial Port : 14,15
#     -- I2C         : 2,3
#     -- HiFiBerry   : 2,3,18,19,20,21      
#     -- USE_BUTTONS --

LED_red=6                      	; Red light
