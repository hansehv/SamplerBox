##  Adapt to your setup !
##  Don't delete value definitions, program expects them all (no internal defaults)
##    - exception to this rule: GPIO definitions of unused devices
##  Values are used 'as is' with hardly any error checking, some friendly warnings:
##    - read the comment ... and do it right, because:
##    - out of range filter values can really hurt an audio system
##    - other errors may just lead to malfunctioning in unexpected ways.

######  Mapping of GPIO_pins: adapt to your hardware wiring/setup  #####
# GPIO modules in this build use mode=BCM. Modes cannot be mixed.

# In example below buttons 18&27 overlap# I use a box with buttons&LCD and one with HiFiBerry&Leds.
# Some devices require no mapping here, but do use pins:
#     -- EEPROM      : 0,1
#     -- Serial Port : 14,15
#     -- I2C         : 2,3

# Increase, increases value/proceeds to next menu choice
